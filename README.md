# Machine-learning-with-Chives-dataset
Machine learning with Chives dataset (least squares regression) with keras and tensor flow 

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features by learning a linear relationship between them.

The implementation replicates the classical least squares regression algorithm through a single-layer neural network that minimizes mean squared error loss.
